## Posting Frequency

| Platform | Frequency | Why |
|----------|-----------|-----|
| X | 4-5x/week | Low effort per post, high discovery. Threads 1x/week. |
| Instagram | 3x/week | Requires visuals. 2 feed posts + 1 Reel/week. Stories daily if possible. |
| TikTok | 2x/week | Video production takes time. Quality > quantity. Batch-film monthly. |

**Total weekly output:** ~10 pieces of content across platforms. Realistic for 1 person + AI automation.

## Content Format Matrix

### X (Twitter)
- **Best formats:** Short takes (< 280 chars), threads (5-10 tweets), quote tweets with commentary
- **Tone:** Direct, punchy, opinionated. Like talking to a smart friend at a bar.
- **Visuals:** Optional but screenshots/diagrams boost engagement
- **Timing:** 8h-9h and 12h-13h (French business hours)

### Instagram
- **Best formats:** Carousels (5-8 slides, educational), Reels (15-30s, demos), Stories (polls, Q&A)
- **Tone:** Same directness but slightly more polished visuals
- **Visuals:** Mandatory. Consistent template with brand colors.
- **Timing:** 12h-13h and 18h-19h

### TikTok
- **Best formats:** Short video (15-60s), screen recordings of AI in action, talking head + demo
- **Tone:** Casual, fast-paced, no corporate filter
- **Visuals:** Raw/authentic > polished. Trending sounds when relevant.
- **Timing:** 18h-21h

## Cross-Posting Rules

### Can cross-post (adapt slightly):
- Blog summaries → X thread + IG carousel + TikTok explainer
- Hot takes → X tweet + IG Story + TikTok stitch
- Tips → All platforms with format adaptation

### Must be platform-native:
- X threads (don't screenshot threads for IG)
- TikTok trends (platform-specific humor/sounds)
- IG carousels (designed for swipe, not just text dumps)

### Adaptation checklist:
1. Rewrite copy for platform tone/length
2. Adjust hashtags per platform rules
3. Resize visuals (X: 16:9, IG: 1:1 or 4:5, TikTok: 9:16)
4. Add platform-specific CTA

- Comment on #PME and #IA content from others
- Retweet/share local business wins
- DM local businesses who engage (not cold — warm follow-up)

### Growth Tactics
- Collaborate with local business accounts for cross-promotion
- Tag relevant accounts (CCI Angers, French Tech, local incubators)
- Respond to AI news within 1 hour (newsjacking)
- Run monthly polls/Q&A ("Quelle tâche vous prend le plus de temps ?")
